# Bouncing Ball Challenge

## Description

In this challenge, I created six different balls moving back and forth on the x axis at different speeds. I also created a boundry to go back and forth on the x axis.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

The balls will begin to move and bounce upon opening of the web browser window. There are not any additional instructions or steps for the user in order to run this program.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include creating a loop to create ball movements.
